    '''
    This method runs a given non-coroutine function concurrently for each task item by the help
    of the asyncio module and a concurrent executor. The executor creates a thread 
    for each task item if no max_threads is set and cleans up its resources afterwards.
    :param func function: The function to run
    :param list tasks: A list of items for each of them we run the function.
    The items will also serve as argument to the function. Each further *args parameter will be used for the function
    :param int max_threads: Limit the number of threads. By default we create a thread for each item
    :param int timeout: Limit the execution time by a timeout
